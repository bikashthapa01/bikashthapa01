I'm Bikash, Computer Science Engineer, I love taking on challenges and breaking things to make them better. I am passionate about programming and learning new stuff. I spent most of the time building stuff with different programming languages. I have a youtube channel called [SmallAcademy](https://youtube.com/smallacademy), where I teach programming as well. 
If you are reading this, then either you are my classmates or you found me through one of the social channels.
